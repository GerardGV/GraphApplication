# GraphApplication
University project where I develop algorithms to find optimal Postman (SalesMan) route: BackTracking, Branch&Bound, Dijkstra, Spanning Tree, Kruskal, Greedy, Probabilistic algorithm.
All algorithms can be found in Graphapplicaction Folder. The rest of the folders contain tests and scrips for the UI.
